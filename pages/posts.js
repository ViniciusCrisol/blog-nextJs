          Contact="Hi, my name is VinÃ­cius Crisol, I am a Brazilian programming student. I
          created this blog with a goal: Help people to solve their problems more
          easily. When I was starting, I didn't have easy access to specific
          information about technologies. With that in mind, I decided to create
          this blog to try to make it easier for those just starting."
